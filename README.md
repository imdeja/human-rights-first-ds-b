### Project Overview
[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/AOaJaAQK/team-b-labs28)

Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances 
of police use of force across the United States for Human Rights First, an 
independent advocacy and action organization.

### Key Features
- User can browse incident map
- User can view specific instances with original source links
- User can view map with various filters

### Data Science API built using:
- FastAPI
- Python
- Docker
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Data Science API
- `/getdata` â€“ We are sending json objects to the backend with information about instances of 
police use of force. This information includes location data (city, state, and 
geocode) and relevant details about the incident, like the type of force that 
was used.

### Issue/Bug Request
**If you are having an issue with the existing project code, please submit a bug report under the following guidelines:**
- Check first to see if your issue has already been reported.
- Check to see if the issue has recently been fixed by attempting to reproduce the issue using the latest master branch in the repository.
- Create a live example of the problem.
- Submit a detailed bug report including your environment & browser, steps to reproduce the issue, actual and expected outcomes, where you believe the issue is originating from, and any potential solutions you have considered.

### Feature Requests
We would love to hear from you about new features which would improve this app and further the aims of our project. Please provide as much detail and information as possible to show us why you think your new feature should be implemented.

### Pull Requests
If you have developed a patch, bug fix, or new feature that would improve this app, please submit a pull request. It is best to communicate your ideas with the developers first before investing a great deal of time into a pull request to ensure that it will mesh smoothly with the project.

### Pull Request Guidelines
- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, including new plist variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
- Ensure that your code conforms to our existing code conventions and test coverage.
- Include the relevant issue number, if applicable.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
